# CS445 Final Project: GIF Video Face Replacement

# About
For the CS445 final project, we wanted to present our take on Snapchat's face filters. 
On social media platforms such as Snapchat, there are a variety of popular filters that users use on a daily basis. One of the most popular kinds of filters involve the pasting of a detected face onto dancing mascots. For the CS445 final projet, we wanted to present our take on these face filters. The focus of this project is to understand how Snapchat engineers create such filters and gain the skills to create a unique filter.

After this is done, you may run cells 1 through 7. In the 8th cell, this is where you will input your desired input images and .mp4 files for processing.

Be sure to change the file path for the variables *cap* and *output_video_path*. In order to change your input video and image, you need to edit the filenames in the variables *face_image* and *cap*. As seen in the image above, the input image *face.png* and input video *snapchat.mp4* are currently loaded. Once you have changed these parameters, run the cell to generate your processed video. The output of this cell will be located in the samples folder in your computer's repository directory.
